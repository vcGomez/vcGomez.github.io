## What This Blog is About

My stuff, particularly technical stuff. I like programming, math, books, random thoughts, dancing and AI. This blog was born of some nice advice from people from HackerNews and a few other blogs. Many of them enjoy blogging for its own sake as a way to better structure their thoughts, summarize learnings, or simply share things they find worth it. That's exactly my intention here.

## Why I Believe I Should Start Blogging

### Enrich the Internet!

I find the current state of the Internet frustrating. We witnessed a centralization of information and interaction in a few websites, and attaching "reddit" to the end of web searches has become very common. Few people even noticed the death of internet forums.

It doesn't have to be that way! Publish whatever you want, whenever you want, and for any reason! It sounds like a recipe for crap content, but I believe it is the exact opposite! Masters love to talk about their subjects and, even if someone is not a master, their experiences navigating through their interests offer unique perspectives and pieces of knowledge that can be shared with the community.

### Long(er) Form Content Has Depth

Ask around your circles how many books they have read in the last year. Even some of my voracious reader friends have noticed they haven't read much recently.

Our attention span have been suffering from the addictive short-form content from social media. But that doesn't mean we can't prevent it from happening! Blogging can be an intermediate between the long form of books and the short form of social media. Blogging is particularly useful in exploring niche topics and get an internal view of the community.

The blogging community seem to have become niche, but the truth is that they are secretly thriving buried in RSS Feeds and scattered links everywhere. Exposing yourself to this community open very interesting new forms of interaction at whatever topic or depth you wish, and the complete control of your platform gives you great freedom of expression.

### Blogging for Learning

Learning through teaching is an excellent way of identifying gaps in your knowledge. By trying to explain concepts, thoughts must be organized and communication skills need to be sharpened to express it in a suitable format for your audience.

The Feynman technique is a well-known method for learning, in which you choose a concept and try to explain it in simple terms. But by writing articles, you do have an audience, so you ARE actually teaching, even if you don't get immediate feedback. This distinction can help you maintain your focus and it prevent you from being satisfied with poor explanations.

I am often interested in how people learn and deal with difficulties on the way, and I see the same patterns over and over. When it comes to learning, variety in your interaction with information, spaced repetition and proving your skills are key. Blogging can be one more tool in your arsenal.

### Improve My Communication Skills

[Few word don't do trick.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_K-L9uhsBLM)

This is a major motivator. I believe better writing means better thinking. Improving communication skills is (hopefully) a natural consequence of writing regularly.

### Help Others

The blog from [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/) is a great example. As she explains in the post about [blogging myths](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/06/05/some-blogging-myths/), there is no need to be an expert to try to teach anyone. All you need is to write about an interesting thing you learned. Any difficulty you face is probably the difficulty of many people, so showing your understanding of it could help a surprising number of people.

### It May Motivate Us to Finish Projects

I am guilty of abandoning more projects than I can count, and I am certainly not alone. Setting a commitment to blog about your project, results and lessons learned can be seen as the cost of starting it in the first place. That is exactly what I plan to do here.

This reason I have read from others, but I am honestly skeptical about it. I guess it depends on the personality, but it is worth a try. :)

### Some Exposition is Good

Exposing yourself is a good way to build a reputation. Many of us do it through work and open source projects, but that form of exposition has limited reach. Blogging allows you to expose exactly what you want in a variety of ways, and your content only accumulates through the years.

### It is Fun

I have heard this from many people, and I am testing this right now. It started feeling good in this post once I got the momentum going, so this reason may have some merit. :)
